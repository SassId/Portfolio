# Information about this project:

Welcome to my Portfolio ! 😁

This is a non exhaustive demo of my previous projects in order to give you a little taste of my style.

What I love in coding and programing is to bridge the gap between front-end design and back-end functionnality.

My goal is to find innovative solutions that delight all stakeholders involved, using my wit and outside-the-box thinking.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to the possibility of collaborating with fellow developers out there.
